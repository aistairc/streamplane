# StreamPlane

Modern distributed stream processing engines (DSPEs) execute tasks in parallel and utilize their built-in peer-to-peer data transfer to deliver intermediate results across distributed nodes. When systems need reconfiguration to adapt to the underlying infrastructure, such as migrating operators from one node to another, backup-and-restore procedures must be conducted, which may cause existing systems to halt. The rapid increase in continuously generated streaming data requires resilient and flexible systems that cannot afford such delays. Additionally, the topology may involve heterogeneous, multi-cluster computing environments, such as edge and cloud servers. Addressing these issues is impractical in current streaming systems. We present StreamPlane to enable flexible and seamless control and reconfiguration of streaming topology on the fly. The key idea is to leverage a distributed in-memory cluster as the control plane on top of the existing DSPEs. StreamPlane maintains runtime information to control the execution of distributed streaming tasks. StreamPlane delivers and temporarily stores in-transit data between nodes to facilitate efficient reconfiguration. Furthermore, it keeps the computational states accessible during reconfiguration. In this demonstration, we present our prototype to attendees to showcase our achievements with the proposed scheme.
